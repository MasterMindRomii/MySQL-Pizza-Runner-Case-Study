# Pizza Runner - SQL Case Study

A comprehensive SQL data analysis project exploring pizza delivery operations, customer behavior, and business metrics for Danny's Pizza Runner startup.

## Overview

Pizza Runner is a data-driven case study that combines pizza delivery with "Uberization" concepts. This project analyzes real-world business scenarios using SQL to optimize operations, understand customer preferences, and improve delivery efficiency.

## Project Objectives

→ Analyze pizza ordering patterns and customer behavior  
→ Evaluate runner performance and delivery metrics  
→ Optimize ingredient management and pricing strategies  
→ Design database solutions for rating systems

## Analysis Areas

### A. Pizza Metrics
→ Total pizza orders and unique customers  
→ Delivery success rates by runner  
→ Pizza type distribution and preferences  
→ Order patterns by time and day  
→ Customer customization analysis

### B. Runner & Customer Experience
→ Runner registration trends  
→ Average pickup and delivery times  
→ Distance analysis per customer  
→ Delivery speed optimization  
→ Success rate calculations

### C. Ingredient Optimization
→ Standard pizza ingredients breakdown  
→ Most popular extras and exclusions  
→ Custom order formatting  
→ Ingredient usage tracking

### D. Pricing & Ratings
→ Revenue calculations with dynamic pricing  
→ Runner payment structure ($0.30/km)  
→ Customer rating system design  
→ Net profit analysis

## Technologies Used

→ SQL (MySQL)  
→ Database design and normalization  
→ Complex joins and aggregations  
→ Window functions and CTEs

## Key Features

→ Data Cleaning: Handled null values and inconsistent data types  
→ Complex Queries: Multi-table joins with aggregations  
→ Business Intelligence: Revenue and operational metrics  
→ Schema Design: Custom rating system implementation

## Sample Insights

→ Analysis of 115M+ kg daily global pizza consumption patterns  
→ Optimization of delivery routes and timing  
→ Customer preference tracking for personalized service  
→ Cost-benefit analysis for delivery operations

## Getting Started

→ Clone the repository  
→ Import the database schema  
→ Run the SQL queries in sequence  
→ Analyze the results

## Case Study Structure

Each section contains progressive difficulty levels:  
→ Basic metrics and counts  
→ Time-based analysis  
→ Advanced calculations  
→ Business strategy queries
